Auditory-Modeling Toolbox (AMT)

AMT depends on LTFAT.  You must first download LTFAT from
http://ltfat.sourceforge.net/ and unpack the downloaded file. 
In the AMT, there is a pre-prepared directory /thirdparty/ltfat
where the LTFAT can be stored and will be automatically recognized by 
the AMT. Alternatively, set the path to your LTFAT directory to the 
search path of Matlab/Octave.

To start the AMT, type "amtstart".

The "amtstart" command will add all the necessary
subdirectories (so please don't add these manually), and will print
statements telling you which backend you are currently using.

Other packages are required to run all the AMT functionality. See 
<http://amtoolbox.sourceforge.net/doc/index.php> and "help amtstart" 
for more details.
