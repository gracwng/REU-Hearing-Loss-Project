Performs the same analysis as \char`\"{}runall.\+m\char`\"{} but considers yet another way of defining audio \char`\"{}without Cam\+E\+Q\char`\"{} for HI listeners. In this case the audio is extracted in the exact same way for NH and HI listeners rather than inverse filtering the already Cam\+EQ equalized files.

\subsection{Detailed Description}
Performs the same analysis as \char`\"{}runall.\+m\char`\"{} but considers yet another way of defining audio \char`\"{}without Cam\+E\+Q\char`\"{} for HI listeners. In this case the audio is extracted in the exact same way for NH and HI listeners rather than inverse filtering the already Cam\+EQ equalized files. 


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em subid} & subject id (an integer between 1 and 44) \\
\hline
{\em bidsdir} & the root of the B\+I\+Ds directory \\
\hline
{\em sdir} & directory in which the features and model results are stored \\
\hline
{\em eegpreproc} & a flag (0/1) that indicates whether or not to build eeg features. by default, it is assumed that \char`\"{}runall\char`\"{} has already been called and that there thus is no need to build these features again \\
\hline
{\em audpreproc} & a flag (0/1) that indicates whether or not to build audio features. this can by handy with limited signal processing licenses \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
