How to replicate this project:

I would first advise reading the paper I wrote associated with this project 

How to get images of scalp maps along each patient's ERP waveform (40 images/patient = 40 images x 44 patients = 1,670 images)

Follow the steps in this repository: https://gitlab.com/sfugl/snhl/-/tree/master
Figure out how to run the extract_erp.m file on your local computer just to test if it works

2. Open the matlab folder in this repository inside MatLab. This matlab folder contains the main scripts I used to handle EEG data associatd with ERPs. 
The script that will start everything is the mainScript.m (matlab > mainScript.m)
This main script calls the export_summaries.m file (matlab > reports > paper > export_summaries.m)
Many lines under 'workflows_paper' (line 27) contains calls to scripts that I experimented writing. 
The script I used to get the 1,670 total images is extract_erp_10ms_interval.m (matlab/reports/paper/func/extract_erp_10ms_interval.m)

The challenging part is that my file path's are local to my computer, so I'm not sure which folders should be included in the path. 
But look closely at the file paths being used. 

Now that I have the data, I experimented with the CNN model. 

I used VSCode as my IDE for my python notebook. 
All my files related to the machine learning model experimentation is located in the machine learning folder in this repo (machine learning/ResNet_50.ipynb)
