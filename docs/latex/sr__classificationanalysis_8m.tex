\subsection{Detailed Description}
Trains a reconstruction model on single-\/talker data using L\+OO and evaluates how accurately the model can be used to discrinate between attended and unattended speech from two-\/talker data. 


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em opts} & configuration structure \\
\hline
{\em opts.\+tdur} & duration of decoding segments (in s) \\
\hline
{\em opts.\+fs} & sampling rate of preprocessed data (e.\+g. fs=64) \\
\hline
{\em opts.\+tshift} & how long are the shifts (in s) between each segment? the decoding segments are nonoverlapping and shifted with opts\+\_\+classification.\+tdur + opts\+\_\+classification.\+tshift) \\
\hline
{\em opts.\+lagoi} & lags of interest (e.\+g. -\/32\+:0) \\
\hline
{\em opts.\+znormd} & flag indicating if the data should be z-\/scored (1) or not (0) \\
\hline
{\em opts.\+lambda} & regularization parameters of interest (e.\+g \mbox{[}1 10 100\mbox{]}) \\
\hline
{\em opts.\+gof} & goodness of fit metric (e.\+g. \textquotesingle{}estcorr\textquotesingle{}) \\
\hline
{\em srdat} & imported and preprocessed audio/\+E\+EG data (see \mbox{\hyperlink{sr__importdata_8m}{sr\+\_\+importdata.\+m}})\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
The backward models in this project are based on ridge-\/regularized filters (and not tikhonov filters as they potentially introduce relatively strong cross-\/channel leakages)

to do\+: right now the opt.\+gof functionality is not included and this function only relies on \textquotesingle{}estcorr\textquotesingle{}. this could be nice to include
