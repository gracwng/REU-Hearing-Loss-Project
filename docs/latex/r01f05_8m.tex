Some of the subjects that were here considered to be normal-\/hearing subjects had audiograms that exceeded 20 dB HL. This function exports figures with data from a subset of the listeners who have a more strict criterion for what is considered to be normal-\/hearing. Specifically, we focus on NH listeners that have audiograms $<$= 20 dB HL at all of the audiometric frequencies and both ears. This results in 10 listeners with an age range from 53 to 69 years old. To make our group comparison more fair, we then similarly extract all HI listeners that are $<$= 69 years old. This results in 11 HI listeners that are matched in age with the NH subset.
