Plots scatter plots, where different entrainment measures are plotted against difficulty ratings. We here show data for reconstruction accuracies and classification accuracies as thes are univariate measures. For illustrative purposes, we show a global regression curve for each subplot. It is not suprising that group differences appear to drive correlations across groups. Note that for S\+SQ scores, higher values indicate less listening difficulties. We do not find that the measures are consistently correlated within groups when considering the two groups separately. Yet, we do not think that we can conclude anything from this, since the study was essentially designed as a group study.
